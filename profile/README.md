# Welcome to the PROVES Kit Open Source! 
Ever since our rocky experiences working with closed and proprietary aerospace hardware on BroncoSat-1 (our first satellite), we have become committed to creating an affordable and accessible open architecture for spacecraft. We've started with a 1U CubeSat kit that has now made it to orbit three times!

The first one didn't get deployed due to an issue with our host vehicle, the second did deploy but only made contact for the first ~50 minutes or so of the flight, and the third 10x'd that number to a confirmed uptime of 9.5 hours! That that kind of exponential growth we're surely only a few updates away from an extremely low cost design that can go the distance. 

# How to Get One
Our design intention was to create a complete satellite platform with a structure, EPS, flight computer, and comms system for less than $1k and we present it here now for the open source community. The practical cost of getting one to space is quite a bit more than $1k (our latest launch got one on orbit for just $5k not including the launch cost!), but that is certainly much more affordable than any commercial platform on the market. We would not recommend you try and build one from scratch unless you have relatively extensive experience with custom PCB and structural manufacturing. 

We're going to be selling the kits as a set of assembled and unassembled 1U's on [our website](https://www.proveskit.space)! 

Also feel free to reach out to Michael Pham at mlpham@cpp.edu if you would like to have a further conversation.

# Check Out Our Partners! 
We couldn't do this without engagement from our community of university CubeSat developers! Our friends at the Stanford Student Space Initiative have done some amazing work and are some of the most exciting people to work. The folks at the Hawaii Space Flight Lab and the Portland Space Aerospace Society OreSat team also have some awesome open source CubeSat architectures of their own!
